            We are a locally owned, small business, operating out of Melfort, Saskatchewan. 
            We offer competitive, online auctions that are focused on selling quality 
            items for clients via an online auction platform. We take care of the listing, selling, 
            packing and shipping of the items brought to our auction location. If wanting to sell an estate, 
            we have a few different options to help provide different alternatives, that work in favour for our clients. Our team consists 
            of members that have many years of experience and expertise in the auction industry, as well as a vast knowledge of antique and collectible items. <br><br>
            Our focus is on selling antiques, collectibles, household goods, and estates. 
            However, we are not limited to these effects. We strive to get you, our clients, 
            the best price for your items, by providing detailed descriptions, many clear, 
            concise pictures, and even personal viewing opportunity for buyers, to get your possessions sold! 
            We invite you to please contact us for any additional information and welcome any new buyer's and sellers to our auctions.
